# Verification-of-APB---Based-UART-Master-Core-RTL
Verification of an APB-based UART Master Core RTL using a SystemVerilog testbench. The project validates APB read/write transactions, UART TX/RX frame generation, baud-rate timing, parity handling, and FIFO behavior. Includes directed and random tests, assertions, and functional coverage to ensure full protocol and functional correctness.
